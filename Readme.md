# Vehicle 2: Redux
- compiles with Java 17

The vehicle app lets you "drive" a very special vehicle: just start the Vehicle2.jar file.

To start driving, use the following keys to control it:
- CURSOR LEFT: drive left 
- CURSOR RIGHT: drive right 
- CURSOR DOWN: dive (in water) 
- CURSOR UP: float to surface (in water) 
- s: rotate turret contra-clockwise 
- f: rotate turret clockwise 
- d: fire the "rope" using the turret; press again to "cut" the rope 
- e: shorten the rope (pull) 
- c: lengthen the rope 
- 1: switch to rope #1 
- 2: switch to rope #2 

You can use the rope to pull the car up the walls and climb, it's kind of a "grappling hook".
In fact, there are two grappling hooks (key 1 and 2 to switch) - if you use them together, you can get almost everywhere.
Trying to go through the level with only one grappling hook might be a bit tricky.

Included game feature: water; You can swim and dive.
Like a submarine, you can change the "density" of the vehicle to make it dive into the water or let it gently float to
the surface using the CURSOR UP and CURSOR DOWN keys.

You can not "win" the game, but you can try to reach the area with the "goal" sign as quickly as possible! 

You can create your own levels, The .jpg defines the "appearance", the .gif has 3 colors that tell the app what type
of terrain is on every pixel.

Based on the original applet from "www.eigelb.at". Included is also the alternate level that was on the original website.
